QuickShopMW
===========

A bukkit plugin for shops.

This is a fork of QuickShop. It adds support for multiple worlds. For example, you have a minecraft bukkit server with the following worlds:

world
world_nether
world_the_end
world2
skyworld

With a compatible multi world economy plugin like iconomy, purchases and sales in world2 will stay in world2 and isolated from money in skyworld for example.

In the future, other functions, bug fixes may be added.
